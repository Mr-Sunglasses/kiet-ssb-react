              Modern ships, submarines, and aircraft are fitted with advanced

              Officer, you will be responsible for keeping all these Hi-tech
              systems serviceable. Opportunities exist to work in gigantic naval
              dockyards and indigenous production units. In no other career is
              an engineer exposed to such a wide spectrum of opportunities and
              to keep abreast of modern developments. An Engineer Officer’s
              career is interspersed with technical courses up to
              post-graduation level in India/abroad. You can also join in the
              Naval Architecture Cadre of the Engineering Branch. The Indian
              Navy today employs the largest pool of trained Naval Architects in

              quality control, repair and new construction work of naval
              vessels. With the Navy going for more and more sophisticated
              warship production within the country, the Corps of Naval
              Architects offers excellent opportunities to keep abreast of the
              advancement in shipbuilding technology and implement your

              A warship is a mini floating city with an integral power

              equipment form the major part of a warship’s equipment. A majority
              of these are either computer-based or computer-aided and
              incorporate the latest trends in electronics engineering. For a
              ship to be able to fight effectively, all these equipment must be
              kept working at peak efficiency. Electrical Officers have this
              responsibility and other challenging tasks. To sharpen their
              skills, the Navy offers excellent opportunities for post-graduate
              courses in India/abroad to deserving candidates. Note: Officers of
              the Engineering and Electrical Branches can also volunteer for the
              Aviation/ Submarine Arm.

            <p>
              Any service will be as good as the training its officers and men
              receive. As an Education Officer, you will play a major role in
              the training of naval officers/sailors. Education Officers are
              responsible for scientific and methodical instructions, including
              theoretical aspects of technical subjects of all branches of the
              navy and also for general education. An Education Officer can
              specialize in almost all specializations of the Executive Branch.
              In addition, some officers also get specialization in Oceanography
              & Meteorology.

                  There are a number of ways in which one could get a commission
                  in the Army. You can join right after school or after
                  graduation. The selection procedures are impartial, objective
                  and are uniformly applied to one and all and have only one aim
                  – to “select the best”.

            </div>
            <p>
              The Army offers both permanent and short service commission.
              Permanent commission (PC) is granted through the Indian Military
              Academy (IMA) Dehradun and Short Service Commission (SSC) is
              granted through Officers Training Academy (OTA) Chennai. When you
              opt for ‘PC’, you are basically looking at a permanent career in
              the Army, a career till you retire. SSC is a wonderful option for
              all those of you who aspire to serve it for a few years. It gives
              you the option of joining the Army and serving it as a
              commissioned officer for ten years. Once your tenure is over, you
              are allowed to opt for PC. Alternatively, you can also ask for a
              four years extension and can choose to resign from your post any
              time during this period.

              Pilot Aptitude Battery Test (PABT) is a unique test. It is aimed
              at assessing a candidate’s aptitude to be trained as a pilot. PABT
              is being used as an independent selection device to induct
              potential officers into the Flying Branch of Indian Air Force.
              PABT comprises three tests viz Instrument Battery Test (INSB),
              Sensory Motor Apparatus Test (SMA) and Control Velocity Test
              (CVT). Instrument Battery Test (INSB) is a paper-pencil test and
              the other two are machine tests. The Instruments Battery Test
              (INSB) comprises two parts. This test assesses the assimilation of
              the briefing and the ability of an individual to read and
              interpret the dials of an instrument panel of an aircraft. The
              candidates who score the minimum laid down criteria are subjected
              to the machine test. The machine test includes the Sensory Motor
              Apparatus Test (SMA) and Control Velocity Test (CVT). These tests
              measure the psychomotor co-ordination skill of the individual.
              These tests are conducted on a single day and administered only
              once in a lifetime.

              step.
