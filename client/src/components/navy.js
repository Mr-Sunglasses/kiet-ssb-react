        Modern ships, submarines, and aircraft are fitted with advanced
        technology machinery and propulsion systems. As an Engineer Officer, you
        will be responsible for keeping all these Hi-tech systems serviceable.
        Opportunities exist to work in gigantic naval dockyards and indigenous
        production units. In no other career is an engineer exposed to such a
        wide spectrum of opportunities and to keep abreast of modern
        developments. An Engineer Officer’s career is interspersed with
        technical courses up to post-graduation level in India/abroad. You can
        also join in the Naval Architecture Cadre of the Engineering Branch. The
        Indian Navy today employs the largest pool of trained Naval Architects
        in India. A Naval Architect is involved in design, construction, quality
        control, repair and new construction work of naval vessels. With the
        Navy going for more and more sophisticated warship production within the
        country, the Corps of Naval Architects offers excellent opportunities to
        keep abreast of the advancement in shipbuilding technology and implement
        your innovative ideas.

        A warship is a mini floating city with an integral power generation and
        distribution system. In addition, complex missile systems, underwater
        weapons, radar, and radio communication equipment form the major part of
        a warship’s equipment. A majority of these are either computer-based or
        computer-aided and incorporate the latest trends in electronics
        engineering. For a ship to be able to fight effectively, all these
        equipment must be kept working at peak efficiency. Electrical Officers
        have this responsibility and other challenging tasks. To sharpen their
        skills, the Navy offers excellent opportunities for post-graduate
        courses in India/abroad to deserving candidates. Note: Officers of the
        Engineering and Electrical Branches can also volunteer for the Aviation/
        Submarine Arm.

        Any service will be as good as the training its officers and men
        receive. As an Education Officer, you will play a major role in the
        training of naval officers/sailors. Education Officers are responsible
        for scientific and methodical instructions, including theoretical
        aspects of technical subjects of all branches of the navy and also for
        general education. An Education Officer can specialize in almost all
        specializations of the Executive Branch. In addition, some officers also
        get specialization in Oceanography &amp; Meteorology.
