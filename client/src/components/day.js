              Tests include a combination of two tests( ie Verbal and
              non-Verbal). Each of the tests has normally 20 to 50 questions
              each depending on particular test used for the day. Time given
              also varies from 15 to 30 minutes for each test. The tests are
              given one after the other, normally without any break. Each
              candidate is assigned a grade on five point scale on the basis of
              marks scored in each test. These tests have minimum marks required
              to pass in each test separately. Therefore candidates are advised
              to take both tests with equal seriousness.

              It is a picture based test. Here candidates will be shown a
              picture for 30 seconds and candidates are required to write a
              story based on that picture in 4 minutes. Candidates will also be
              required to write the action of the story, mood of the story and
              mark the characters in the picture. Once the story writing is
              over. The candidates are divided into small groups and are seated
              in a Semi Circle. Three assessors i.e IO, GTO & Psychologist, form
              a team for assessment of every group. GTO moderates the discussion
              and all the three assessors assess the suitability of the
              candidate for Stage –II selection. Each candidate is required to
              narrate his story in one minute one by one. The candidates are
              then asked to discuss the story and make a common story. Once they
              seem to have come to a conclusion the group is asked to give out
              the common story. The group may nominate any candidate for the
              purpose. The assessors conduct an on the spot conference, for each
              group, and decide who all are going to Stage II testing based on
              the performance in Stage –I. The results are compiled and declared
              after all groups have undergone stage-1 tests. Those candidates
              who pass Stage -1 Testing stay for next 3 or 4 days and rest of
              the candidates deport immediately thereafter for their homes.
              Candidates are assessed IN/OUT on the basis of their performance
              in OIR tests as well as in the discussion.

            <p>
              The written tests are conducted by the Psychologist. Time factor
              in these tests is of paramount importance. Candidates are given
              time limit for writing answers to various given questions. The
              candidates are required to complete the tests within the
              stipulated time frame. The psychologist at the SSB explains to the
              candidate about various tests one by one, along with illustrations
              to enable the candidates to understand exactly how each test will
              be conducted and what is expected from them. In case of doubts,
              candidates are at liberty to ask the testing officer to clarify,
              before the commencement of every test.

            </div>
            <p>
              TAT is the first test administered by the psychologist. Through
              the stories written by the candidates in this test, the
              psychologist gets an opportunity to explore the subconscious mind
              of the candidate. Picture shown to the candidate stimulates his
              imagination and the story written by the candidate serves as a
              medium, for the psychologist to investigate and scrutinize closely
              the basic characteristics of a candidate. The test is a
              specialized technique to bring out various traits of the
              personality of a candidate. The stories written by the candidate
              reflect his personality in various dimensions. The candidate’s
              response to the pictures in the form of stories yields sufficient
              material with the help of which temperamental make up and
              emotional attitude can be judged. The process is based on the
              principle that the individual thoughts are woven around the object
              relationship. The psychologist interprets the stories to find out
              whether the candidate is endowed with the qualities that are
              required for an officer of the Defence Forces.

            <p>
              Word Association Test (WAT) is a specially designed second
              Psychological test. Words shown to the candidates in the test are
              not selected at random. They are specially chosen and arranged in
              a definite pattern. The psychologist on the basis of the responses
              comes to conclusions about the traits of the candidate. WAT brings
              out the real and latent qualities of the candidate to the surface
              and then psychologist assesses his suitability as an officer in
              the armed forces. In Word Association Test an individual is shown
              a word for 15 seconds. He is required to write the first idea that
              comes to his mind in the form of a meaningful complete sentence.

            </div>
            <p>
              Situation Reaction Test is the third test given by the
              psychologist in series of psychological tests. SRT is designed to
              test the responses of an individual in day- to-day situations. The
              objective of the test is to judge whether a candidate possess guts
              and capacity to tackle odd situations with an alert mind. The test
              brings out the qualities of clear thinking, logical course of
              action and quick decision making. It also reveals whether the
              candidate is capable of putting up with stress and strains without
              losing nerves. As an officer of Indian Armed Forces the candidate
              may need to tackle such situations during his course of
              activities. This test therefore helps in determining the
              suitability of a candidate for selection as an officer. For a good
              performance, candidate needs the ability to write what he would
              have done or what he could do in such a situation. A candidate is
              required to give his reactions to all sixty situations in Thirty
              minutes. However, if one does not understand any particular
              situation, he may leave that and proceed ahead reacting to other
              situations without wasting time. A candidate is required to write
              only two to three lines in response to each situation. The space
              provided is only for that much.

              Self-description test is conducted after the situation reaction
              test. Self-description test is meant to assess the insight of a
              candidate. If the candidate knows himself and is conscious of his
              weaknesses, he will overcome these and improve his personality. In
              case a candidate lacks insight he cannot improve his shortcomings.
              In this test a candidate is given 15 minutes to write 5
              paragraphs. Each paragraph should be of 6 to 8 lines. The
              paragraphs are as under:

              the physical qualities of candidates like toughness, stamina etc.
              but leadership qualities like originality of ideas, planning,
              organizing, and confidence, co-operation are also equally well
              brought into play.

              Interviewing Officer (I.O.). In addition to appraising the present
              level of the candidate, the IO tries to evaluate the training
              potential of the candidate. The questions at the interview are
              directed so as to allow the candidate to automatically show his
              leadership ability in his answers.
