            There are a number of ways in which one could get a commission in
            the Army. You can join right after school or after graduation. The
            selection procedures are impartial, objective and are uniformly
            applied to one and all and have only one aim – to “select the best”.

        <p>Types of Commission</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        The Army offers both permanent and short service commission. Permanent
        commission (PC) is granted through the Indian Military Academy (IMA)
        Dehradun and Short Service Commission (SSC) is granted through Officers
        Training Academy (OTA) Chennai. When you opt for ‘PC’, you are basically
        looking at a permanent career in the Army, a career till you retire. SSC
        is a wonderful option for all those of you who aspire to serve it for a
        few years. It gives you the option of joining the Army and serving it as
        a commissioned officer for ten years. Once your tenure is over, you are
        allowed to opt for PC. Alternatively, you can also ask for a four years
        extension and can choose to resign from your post any time during this
        period.
