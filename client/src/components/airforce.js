        Pilot Aptitude Battery Test (PABT) is a unique test. It is aimed at
        assessing a candidate’s aptitude to be trained as a pilot. PABT is being
        used as an independent selection device to induct potential officers
        into the Flying Branch of Indian Air Force. PABT comprises three tests
        viz Instrument Battery Test (INSB), Sensory Motor Apparatus Test (SMA)
        and Control Velocity Test (CVT). Instrument Battery Test (INSB) is a
        paper-pencil test and the other two are machine tests. The Instruments
        Battery Test (INSB) comprises two parts. This test assesses the
        assimilation of the briefing and the ability of an individual to read
        and interpret the dials of an instrument panel of an aircraft. The
        candidates who score the minimum laid down criteria are subjected to the
        machine test. The machine test includes the Sensory Motor Apparatus Test
        (SMA) and Control Velocity Test (CVT). These tests measure the
        psychomotor co-ordination skill of the individual. These tests are
        conducted on a single day and administered only once in a lifetime.
