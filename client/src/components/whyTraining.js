                Defence Forces is one such organization which doesn’t want the
                best people as officers, they want the right people. In other
                organizations if you go and there are ‘n’ number of people who
                have come there for interview, then they’ll select based on the
                number of posts. They’ll select amongst the lot, who they think
                is best for the job. Where as in SSB they want the right fit. If
                they won’t find the right fit, they’ll simply reject all the
                other people, if they find the right fit in all, then they’ll
                recommend all. You must have read that there is a shortage of
                officers in the forces, this is the major reason for that. Since
                SSB is a very tough interview and they want the right fit and
                not the best one, hence the reason for the vacant seats.

              In SSB three people access you from three different perspectives.
              The psychologist accesses you from your mind, he/she makes sure
              that you have the necessary qualities that an officer must have,
              by putting you under several tests. The Interviewing officers
              talks to you one on one and draws his conclusion based on your
              answers. The GTO tests you for your group compatibility and other
              social qualities. If you are passed by any two (in some cases all
              three), then only you are recommended. The conclusions of these
              officers are independent and nobody interferes in other one’s
              deduction. They never discuss anything about any candidate accept
              for the board conference.

              It is said that in order to pass the SSB you must be the same
              person in all the three assessors’ conclusion. This means you must
              possess certain OLQ’s and these should be the same in all the
              three results. In other words what you write in the psychological
              tests papers should be in line with what you say to the
              interviewing officer and these should match with how you perform
              in the GT series. If you are not putting any fake reaction then
              generally the results of all three assessors must match, thus you
              get recommended. Due to lack of awareness most of the students are
              not able to perform well despite having all the required
              qualities. This is one of the reason that KIET Group of
              Institution has taken over this responsibility to groom eligible
              and deserving students for SSB.
